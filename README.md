# MachineLearningStockExchangeShares
I intend to create a Neural Network for forecasting stock values on the stock exchange. The variables I want to use are: 1. the closing values of the past day of the trading session; 2. use a variable that shows market sentiment regarding matters related to the company. I explain. I want to capture from the internet, from the news databases on economics, excerpts of texts or words, that after analyzing the sentiment, give me a way out, 0 or 1. If it is 0, the action tends to fall, if it is 1, the stock tends to go up. Therefore, the entries of the Neural Network, in theory, would be: 0, for the fall of the stock of the last x days of closing of the stock exchange; 1, for discharging the stock from the last x closing day; 0, for market sentiment down, last day; 1, for the market sentiment to bullish, last day. Finally, make the forecast for the future day. The language must be in Python.
